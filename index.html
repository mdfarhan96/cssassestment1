    <h2 class="head2">What is Css?</h2>
    <ol class="maroon">
        <li>css stands for cascading style sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b> <del>Css is not neccesary</del>  <span style="background-color: yellow;">  CSS saves a lot of work</span></b>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li> <u> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="head2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="space maroon">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
         <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<b><span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span></b> , because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
